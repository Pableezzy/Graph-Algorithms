Program Summary:

This program will implement a Graph ADT, Graph.c/Graph.h, and run the Breath First Search (BFS) and the Depth First Search (DFS) Algorithms 
on the Graph. In the FindComponents.c file, the program takes input vertices in a file and writes the Adjacency List of the vertices, as well as 
finds the strongly connected components of a digraph. It prints the result to an output file. In the FindPath.c file, the program outputs 
the distance from the source vertex to the destination, and prints the shortest path within an output file.

Note: The Adjacency List is a doubly linked-list implemented in the List.c and List.h files.
